# Capstone Data Science Projects

This repository is focused on three separate Machine Learning Projects from inception including exploratory data analysis, data preparation, model selection, and model evaluation.  The purpose of this repository is focused on my personal area of interest, medical applications of data science principles.

### Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning

Breast cancer continues to be a significant culprit of morbidity and mortality, even today with our current medical advances. The data that this dataset consists of was actually published in a medical journal article and data was collected at the University of Wisconsin (Wolberg, M.D. et al.Â¸1995). While this source is somewhat dated, my main goal with this project is to demonstrate that machine learning algorithms could be used to assist in cancer detection as adjunct to physician expertise.

The data is from the University of California - Irvine Machine Learning Repository and can be found here: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)

### Heart Failure Survival Prediction

Cardiovascular disease is still an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Heart failure, which is an inability for the heart to pump blood efficiency can easily be fatal and diagnosis can be challenging. While traditional machine learning has not been extensively used in clinical medicine outside of academic research environments, there are many different applications of this.

Heart failure can be particularly devastating and caused by a wide variety of different clinical entities and many times, the cause is unknown. Certain therapies have been shown to improve outcomes in heart failure but is there a way to better detect mortality from heart failure to perhaps increase monitoring and intensify management of heart failure patients?
